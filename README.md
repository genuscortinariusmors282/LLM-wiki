# LLM Wiki

You've been here before:

- New session. AI remembers nothing. You spend 20 minutes re-explaining.
- "What did we decide about the pricing formula?" Buried in a 3-hour chat log.
- Five docs in Notion, three in Google Drive, two Excel files on desktop. Which one is current?

This repo fixes that. Not with another knowledge management theory post, but with a drop-in engineering practice that works across AI platforms.

## The Idea

Baseline from [Andrej Karpathy's LLM Wiki pattern](https://gist.github.com/karpathy/442a6bf555914893e9891c11519de94f): the correct way to use LLMs is not Q&A, it's **compilation**.

```
raw/  (PDFs, Excel, client docs — immutable source material)
  ↓  LLM compiles
wiki/ (markdown — current consensus, continuously updated)
  ↓  LLM generates
code/ (the execution layer — a compiled artifact, not the truth)
```

Five rules:

1. **Compile-first** — Don't just answer. Write conclusions into wiki pages.
2. **Writeback is mandatory** — Every decision goes back to the wiki. Every single one.
3. **Wiki before RAG** — Under ~100 docs, LLM reads directly. No vector DB needed.
4. **Obsidian is replaceable, the paradigm is not** — The engine is LLM + filesystem + markdown.
5. **Ideas outrank Code** — Your wiki of decisions and formulas is worth more than the code it generates.

## Works With Any AI

| Platform | Config File | Status |
|----------|------------|--------|
| Claude Code | `CLAUDE.md` | Full template in UNIVERSAL.md |
| Codex | `AGENTS.md` | Native skill + template |
| Cursor | `.cursorrules` | Template in UNIVERSAL.md |
| Windsurf | `.windsurfrules` | Template in UNIVERSAL.md |
| ChatGPT | Manual paste | Workflow in UNIVERSAL.md |

**Just send your AI this link and tell it to read `UNIVERSAL.md`:**

```text
Read https://github.com/Ss1024sS/LLM-wiki/blob/main/UNIVERSAL.md and set up the knowledge system for this project.
```

## Quick Start

### Option A: Tell your AI to do it

```text
Read https://github.com/Ss1024sS/LLM-wiki/blob/main/UNIVERSAL.md and set up the knowledge system for this project.
```

Works with Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Windsurf.

### Option B: Run the bootstrap script

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ss1024sS/LLM-wiki.git
python3 LLM-wiki/skills/knowledge-system-bootstrap/scripts/bootstrap_knowledge_system.py /path/to/your-project "My Project"
```

Generates wiki structure, manifests, validation scripts, and agent config in one command.

### Option C: Install as Codex skill

```text
Use $skill-installer to install https://github.com/Ss1024sS/LLM-wiki/tree/main/skills/knowledge-system-bootstrap
```

Or manually:

```bash
bash scripts/install-codex-skill.sh
```

## How Do I Know It's Working?

After 3 sessions, check:

- [ ] `docs/wiki/log.md` has 3 entries
- [ ] `docs/wiki/current-status.md` reflects actual project state
- [ ] AI can answer "what did we do last time?" without you re-explaining
- [ ] Decisions from session 1 are still accessible in session 3

See `examples/demo-project/` for what a healthy wiki looks like after a few sessions.

---

## Don't Do These Things

- Don't put raw PDFs/XLSX into Git. That's a binary junk pile, not version control.
- Don't treat chat history as memory. It evaporates.
- Don't build a RAG pipeline before your raw docs are even organized.
- Don't change code without updating the wiki. That's incomplete work.
